# Stardew_Valley_Dashboard
WIP - Dashboard for all things Stardew Valley!

# 🌾 Stardew Valley Interactive Dashboard

WIP - Welcome to my deep-dive into **Stardew Valley**, reimagined as a data analytics portfolio project! This Tableau dashboard explores the seasonal rhythm of the game — crops, characters, birthdays, events, and fish — using real gameplay data from multiple sources.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project creates a fully interactive info dashboard using **Tableau**, where users can explore:

- 🌻 **Seasonal Pages** – One page for each in-game season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
- 📅 **Calendar of Events & Birthdays** – Interactive calendar with links to character profiles
- 🌽 **Crops Dashboard** – Compare profitability, growth times, and crop value by season
- 🎣 **Fishing Dashboard** – Fish availability by time, location, and weather
- 🧍 **Villager Info Pages** – Gift preferences, friendship tips, and relationship data
